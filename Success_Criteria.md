# login-server

## Success_Criteria

A file (or files) should be used to store current usernames and passwords. A user can choose to log in or to create a new account. The login process will involve the user entering a username and password. The program should then check this against the existing accounts and log the user in or display an error.
If the user chooses to create a new account then they should be asked for a username (which should be unique) and a strong password (which should include at least one upper case character, one lower case character and one digit). Provided both values are valid, the new account should be added to the file (or files) for existing users.

Prompt the user to create 5 password recovery questions during the creation of their account. Add a 3rd menu option to allow a user to view their password. The program should pick two of the password recovery questions at random. If the user gets both correct they will have their password displayed to them.
