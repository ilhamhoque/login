# login
## Criteria

- A program to manage user accounts with secure login and account creation features. Usernames and passwords are stored in a file. Users can log in by entering their credentials, which are validated against existing accounts. If they choose to create a new account, they must provide a unique username and a strong password (containing at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit). The new account is added to the file if valid.

- During account creation, users must set up five password recovery questions. The program includes an option to view passwords by correctly answering two randomly selected recovery questions.
